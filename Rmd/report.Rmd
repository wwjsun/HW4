#Abstract 
The study compared patients undergoing aortic surgery following one vs. multiple cardiac intervention. 

#Patients and methods
The data contains 360 subjects who had their first re-do aortic surgery and 69 subjects who had multiple re-do aortic surgeries. The four hundred and twenty-nine patients all came from the same US academic healthcare system. 

#Results
We're able to summarize the important variables for the Frist_Redo vs. Multiple_Redo analysis. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(gtsummary)
#read in the data
Num_of_Redo <- read.csv(file='Num_of_Redo.csv', header=TRUE)
#create a subset of dataset select variable that are interested
Sub_Num_Redo <- Num_of_Redo %>% select(MR, Patient_Age, 
                                       Male, pre_CVA, Diabetes,
                                       HTN, Cross_clamp_time, 
                                       Mort_30d)
#create the table
Table_Redo <- Sub_Num_Redo %>% tbl_summary(by = MR) %>% add_p()

#knitr::include_tables(here::here("figs", "Table_Redo"))
```


The Kaplan Meier survival curve for both group looks like this: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "KM_figure.png"))
```
#Discussion
As we see in Figure \@ref(fig:KM_figure.png), the multiple redo group has a sharp drop within 30 days compare to the first redo group.
